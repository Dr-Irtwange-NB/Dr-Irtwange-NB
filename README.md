## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Dr. Irtwange Nguwasen Blessing. 

Iâ€™m a licensed veterinarian with a passion for data analytics. 

Merging my hands-on experience in animal care with cutting-edge analytical skills, I transform complex data into actionable insights that drive better health outcomes and smarter technology use. 

When Iâ€™m not at the clinic, I share my discoveries and insights on my blog [The Vet Vortex](https://thevetvortex.blogspot.com/), connecting the dots between veterinary science and data-driven innovation. 

Iâ€™m excited to bring this unique blend of expertise to a forward-thinking team and help shape the future of veterinary care with data.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a case study analyzing smart device usage trends and their applications in veterinary care. Iâ€™m also building my junior data analyst portfolio.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning digital illustration to create unique visuals for my veterinary blog, The Vet Vortex."

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects in veterinary medicine, pet health analytics, and zoonotic disease research.
